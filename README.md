# Computational-Photography

How computation impacts the entire workflow of photography, which is traditionally aimed at capturing light from a 3D scene to form a 2D image has been explored. A detailed study of the perceptual, technical and computational aspects of forming pictures, and more precisely the capture and depiction of reality on a (mostly 2D) medium of images is undertaken. The scientific, perceptual, and artistic principles behind image-making are emphasized, especially as impacted and changed by computation.

Topics include the relationship between pictorial techniques and the human visual system; intrinsic limitations of 2D representations and their possible compensations; and technical issues involving capturing light to form images. Technical aspects of image capture and rendering, and exploration of how such a medium can be used to its maximum potential, will be examined. New forms of cameras and imaging paradigms are explored.

Programming has been completed in *Python* using numpy, scipy, openCV libraries.
